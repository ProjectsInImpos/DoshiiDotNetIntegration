	/// The <c>ITransactionManager</c> is the core interface of the Doshii SDK.
	/// When a partner wishes to make a payment via Doshii, the SDK emits a 
	/// <see cref="ITransactionManager.ReadyToPay"/> call.
	/// At this point, the POS should place the corresponding Order into a "locked" state and send back the final
	/// details of the Order to ensure that the Order is current in Doshii. Once the partner captures the funds
	/// to pay off the Order, the Doshii SDK emits a 
	/// <see cref="ITransactionManager.RecordSuccessfulPayment(Transaction)"/>
	/// call to finalize the payment. A payment canceled by the partner will cause the SDK to emit a call to
	/// <see cref="ITransactionManager.CancelPayment(Transaction)"/>, at which
	/// point the POS should unlock the Order without accepting payment.
